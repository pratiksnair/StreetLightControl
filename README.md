# 🚦 Street Light Control System

An automatic street light control system designed to enhance pedestrian safety by signaling oncoming drivers when pedestrians are crossing the road. This project uses an **8051 microcontroller** simulated in **Proteus**, with logic programmed in **C** and **Assembly**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Detects pedestrians using **infrared (IR) sensors**
- Sends signals to alert oncoming vehicles
- Simulated using **Proteus Design Suite**
- Programmed using **Embedded C** and **Assembly**
- Ideal for smart city and road safety applications

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **8051 Microcontroller**
- **Proteus Simulation Software**
- **Infrared Sensors**
- **Embedded C**
- **Assembly Language**

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **IR sensors** detect the presence of pedestrians.
2. The **8051 microcontroller** processes the signal.
3. If a pedestrian is detected, the system activates a **signal light** to alert vehicles.
4. Once the pedestrian has crossed, the signal resets.
